            <h3>Unbalanced Economy Performance and Education Expenditure</h3>
            <div class="gap50"></div>
            <p>In China, the economic performances differ from provinces to provinces. The GDP/Capita provides a
                basic measure of the value of output per person.
                <br>The volume of education expenditure is directly correlated with the economic prowess of the
                region.
                <br>The education expenditure is unbalanced distributed between urban centres and the least
                developed
                regions. This applies both in the sense of the distribution of the national budget across regions,
                and also in terms of different regions’ varying abilities in raise local funding for education
                institutions.

            <h3>Unbalanced Higher Education Instituitions</h3>
            <div class="gap50"></div>
            <p>As you can see, the number of the Double Frst Class Universities strongly correlates with the
                education expenditures of each provinces</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Unbalanced Higher Education Instituitions</h3>
            <div class="gap50"></div>
            <p>Once we take in consideration of population, it looks more inbalanced.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="map4" class='step mapTextContent' data-width='60%' data-index='2'>
            <div class="gap50"></div>
            <h3>Unbalanced Enrollment Rates</h3>
            <div class="gap50"></div>
            <p>As we can see the enrollment rates are highly correlated with the number of Double First Class
                Universities in China. This is because the local governments and the universities they fund have an
                interest in prioritising the access of students with local “hukou” status; The higher the component
                of municipal finance is in the funding of a university, the higher the bargaining power the local
                government would have in resisting the national guidelines on opportunity equality.</p>

            <h3>Elite Capture</h3>
            <div class="gap50"></div>
            <p>Some city/provinces might change, but the the economic performaces or enrollment rates are always
                high among these cities. Inequalities are instituted and defended by the privileged classes in order
                to maintain their exclusive hold over scare education resources, which is a source of their
                privileged status. Education in China may face a state of “elite capture”, where a select elite
                which benefit from current inequalities in the distribution of education resources use their power
                to defend their vested interest in maintaining the status quo</p>
