Yuncheng Shanxi,0, $7203,$6300,Yuncheng.png, A is a hard-working child. She always ranked top 5% in her class. She believed the only way to measure success is the good score at the exam. Thus she studied really hard, including writing down every single world the teacher said and finishing at least 2 practice books for each subject. She typically studies 15 hours per day (6:30 - 12:30,and 13:00 -22:00). Becuase her family is generally poor, she used pencil instead of pen for exam since pencils were cheaper than the pen.
